## The ABCFNet code will be open-sourced soon.

# Adaptive Boundary Enhancement and Cross Fusion Linear self-Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images



In this repository, a novel network model ABCFNet is proposed to solve the problems of boundary information loss, lack of detail information, lack of multi-scale features and difficulty of small target recognition in remote sensing image feature extraction.
